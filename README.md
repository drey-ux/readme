Frontend Web Development
=================
Frontend Web Development deals with the visual part of a website. It could also deal with creating user interfaces and planning experiences.

To create the front end, engineers use the combination of HTML (for basic page structure and content), CSS (for visual editing), and JavaScript (for making websites interactive).

HTML: the key front-end technology 
=================
HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language) is a computer language designed to create websites that later can be explored by anybody who accesses the Internet. 

HTML is normally employed to structure a web document. It defines such elements as headlines or paragraphs and enables embedding images, video, and other media.

CSS: styling your facade
=================
CSS (or Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language. Itâ€™s applied to define how HTML elements are supposed to be presented on a webpage in terms of design, layout, and variations for diverse devices with different screen sizes. 

CSS masters the layout of numerous different web pages at a time.
